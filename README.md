This is a tile-based game that I've created in the early summer of 2018 after watching a tutorial. I think it worth uploading to GitHub. 

Created full game engine to incorporate all specified and unspecified features in the games, including asset rendering, camera movement, dialogs, player actions, menu systems, statistics, and music integration.

# Implementation details
- Game is created in such a way that new features can be added easily
- Each and every logic is divided accordingly so that different parts of code can be maintained separately (useful if you're in a team).
- All oops principle is applied here(not that much complicated).

# Requirements
-   Install Java JDK, JRE

<b>Is enought to build this project.</b>
I've used eclipse to ease my development process.

Have a try.
