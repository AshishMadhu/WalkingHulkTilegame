This is a tile-based game that I've created in the early summer of 2018 after watching a tutorial. I think it worth uploading to GitHub. Each and every part of the game is coded from scratch, from updating frames, loading assets, all and all.  

# Implementation details
- Game is created in such a way that new features can be added easily
- Each and every logic is divided accordingly so that different parts of code can be maintained separately (useful if you're in a team).
- All oops principle is applied here(not that much complicated).

# Requirements
-   Install Java JDK, JRE

<b>Is enought to build this project.</b>
I've used eclipse to ease my development process.

Have a try.
