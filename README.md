This is a tile based game which I've created in early summer of 2018 after watching a tutorial. I think it worth uploading into git. Each and every part of the game is coded from scratch, updating frames, loading assets, all and all.

# Implementation details
- Game is created in such a way that new features can be added easily
- Each and every logic is divided accordingly so that different parts of code can be mainted separatly (useful if you're in a team).
- All oops principle are applied here(not that much complecated).

# Requirements
-   Install Java JDK, JRE

<b>Is enought to build this project.</b>
I've used eclispe to easy my development process.

Have a try.
